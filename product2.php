One of the island's highlights, it is a 410ft-long curved pedestrian bridge above Mount Mat Cinchang. It may sound like a cliche but it is really true - the views from here are simply stunning - great for those Kodak moments. Located 2,300ft above sea level, the Sky Bridge is easily accessible by the Langkawi Cable Car. The journey to the top starts out at the Oriental Village in the upper northwest of Langkawi Island, near Pantai Kok.
